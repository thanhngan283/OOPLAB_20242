Question: If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build 
a DVD by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this?  

Answer:
Yes, Java allows to create multiple constructor methods for a class, as long as they have different parameter lists. This is known as constructor overloading.
